# Coordinated-Cleaning-Robot-using-Mesa
A team of autonomous cleaning robots operates on a 20×30 grid (600 cells). At the beginning of each simulation:  100 cells are randomly selected as dirty (uniform, no overlap). N robots (N ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}) start at random clean cells. The goal: clean all 200 dirty cells in ≤ 500 time steps.
